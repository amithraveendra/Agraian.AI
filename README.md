AGRAIAN.AI 

Agrarian.AI is a pioneering platform that integrates Ethereum blockchain 
technology with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to revolutionize 
agricultural market transactions. At its core, the Ethereum blockchain serves as a 
secure and transparent ledger, ensuring the integrity and traceability of 
agricultural products throughout the supply chain. Smart contracts automate 
interactions and guarantee adherence to predefined terms, fostering trust among 
stakeholders. The platform leverages dual machine learning models, Support 
Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest, to predict optimal pricing strategies 
based on historical and current agricultural data, empowering farmers to make 
data-driven decisions. 

The producer module enables farmers to input and manage crop details 
seamlessly, integrating them into the blockchain for increased security and 
transparency. Conversely, the customer module provides consumers with 
comprehensive product information stored on the blockchain, aiding in informed 
purchasing decisions. Through user-friendly web interfaces and predictive 
insights, Agrarian.AI transforms the agricultural market by enhancing economic 
efficiency, market transparency, and sustainability. Rigorous testing processes 
ensure the reliability, functionality, and security of the platform, paving the way 
for its successful deployment and adoption within the agricultural industry.
